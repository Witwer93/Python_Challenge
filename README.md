# Python_Challenge

pypoll_main.py and pybank_main.py are python files specifically designed to meet the criteria for Homework 3 of the DU Datascience Boot Camp

Each file reads in a csv file, extracts important information, and then reports it back to the user in both the terminal and in attached txt files.

pybank_main.py could theoretically work on another csv file, provided it had an identical dataset format and you were looking
for the same type of information.

Unfortunately pypoll is currently written to only work on this specific election_data.csv file and it won't do anything useful if
given a different csv file. Hopefully I will learn enough about using dictionaries so that pypoll_main.py could be adjusted
to work on other similarly formated csv files.

Thank You
